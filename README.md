This is a simple weather application done with VITE+REACT.
It currently shows the following information:
Location
Temperature
Humidity
Wind Speed

It fetches data from the openweathermap.org API, the api call needs only the location input, if you want more information or a more detailed input, check https://openweathermap.org/current for different calls depending on your needs.

This application is done as a learning opportunity, the front-end design is minimal.
